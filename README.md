## Reflection
  As a third year ICT student, I realized that while I am learning a lot technically, I did not fully understand how to position myself for a better future career in the tech industry. I wanted to build a clear career path and learn how to market myself effectively to potential employers. So I took a Work readiness module "Career development" topic to guide me in understanding myself and what I want my future career to be like. The module helped me clarify my goals, guided me in developing a clear and straightforward action plan to become a web developer or UX/UI designer and it made me realize the importance of soft skills like communication and time management, which I know practice in my group projects.

# SKILLS AND INTERESTS
## Evidence

## Reflection
  On the next part of the Work readiness module, I took a Skills and Interest topic which is made to help students identify their strengths, weaknesses, career interests and job specific skills, as I was unsure whether I wanted to focus more on data science, software development or UI/UX. My goal was to figure out which career really aligns with my natural abilities and interests so that I can begin building the right skill set and tailor my career preparations accordingly. I identified my top values and my interests by taking a career and interest quiz, then noted down which career my interests align more with. I discovered I really enjoy working with data and solving problems but also love expressing my creativity in designing logos and posters, and this helped me to fix my cv and tailor it properly for the role I want to achieve.

# PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT

## Reflection
  During the Personality Assessment part of the module, there were plenty of tasks to complete, to help us better understand our personality traits and how we fit into different working environments. My goal was to do the assessment to be able to identify my strengths, weaknesses and areas for improvement. I took the time to evaluate myself through the six personality types and noted which categories I aligned with and then I explored the careers that match my preferences. Understanding my personality helped me realize that I strive in a very calculated working environment as I enjoy being assigned roles and being led, but I'm also now getting more confident as the groups I work with allow me to feel heard and confident in voicing any suggestions or ideas I come up with.

# CREATE A CV
## Evidence

## Reflection
  As we reached the next part of the module "Create CV", I realized that the cv I possessed had very little and outdated information. I needed to create a professional, targeted CV that would make me stand out when applying for internships in software development, UI/UX role, or IT support. I updated my CV to showcase my soft and technical skills and also showed university projects that I've been working on like the car voting system, the e-commerce websites and the library management system. I ended up with a CV that has all my recent and important details, and I learned to also write a cover letter that accompanies it.

## Reflection
  The previous CV that I had constructed had a couple of errors that the module instructor pointed out. I had to redo my CV again making sure that this time I included appropriate references, and that I use reverse chronological order when listing my experiences or recent works. I reconstructed and updated my CV to have my details all in order from having my projects in reverse chronological order to listing my references properly with clear and full contact details. I ended up with an up-to-date CV that is role specific, and I've been using it to apply for internships and within 2 weeks one application already landed me an interview.
